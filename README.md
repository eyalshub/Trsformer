# ðŸ”¥ Learning Transformer Architecture - Encoding & Decoding with 20 Newsgroups

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to **understanding and implementing the Transformer architecture** by working with **both Encoding and Decoding tasks** using the **20 Newsgroups dataset**.  

ðŸš€ The goal of these projects is to explore how Transformers process text **from both perspectives**:
- **Encoding** - Understanding text representations (word embeddings & tokenization).
- **Decoding** - Generating text summaries using a trained Transformer model.

## ðŸ§© Project 1: Encoding 20 Newsgroups
ðŸ“Œ **Notebook:** [Encoding 20 Newsgroups](https://github.com/eyalshub/Trsformer/blob/main/encoding_20newsgroups.ipynb)

ðŸ”¹ **What We Did:**
- **Preprocessed** the 20 Newsgroups dataset.
- **Explored tokenization techniques** (e.g., Word2Vec, BPE, SentencePiece).
- **Trained an encoding model** to generate embeddings.
- **Analyzed how different encoding methods impact text representation.**

ðŸ“Š **Main Takeaways:**
- Understanding how words are converted into numerical representations.
- Experimenting with various encoding architectures.
- Preparing data for downstream tasks like classification or summarization.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project 2: Decoding - Summarization with T5
ðŸ“Œ **Notebook:** `decoding_20newsgroups.ipynb` (To be uploaded)

ðŸ”¹ **What We Did:**
- Built a **Transformer Decoder** from scratch.
- Faced major challenges (nonsense outputs, repetition, training instability).
- Switched to **Fine-Tuning T5** for a robust summarization model.
- Successfully **generated meaningful summaries** from 20 Newsgroups articles.

ðŸ”¹ **Technologies Used:**
- PyTorch & Hugging Face `transformers`
- `T5-small` for summarization
- ROUGE score evaluation

ðŸ“Š **Main Takeaways:**
- Understanding **how Decoders work** in NLP.
- Experimenting with **beam search & top-k sampling**.
- Fine-Tuning an **existing model** for better results.
